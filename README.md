# Artificial neeural network and deep learning challenges polimi 

### Challenge 1: Leaf Classification Challenge

In this university challenge, we used convolutional neural networks to classify different types of leaves based on images. We used Jupyter notebooks to develop and train the models, and TensorFlow with GPU support to speed up the process.

### Challenge 2: Time Series Challenge

In this university challenge, we used recurrent neural networks to forecast future values in a time series dataset. We applied various techniques to preprocess and transform the data, and implemented and trained the models using TensorFlow.
